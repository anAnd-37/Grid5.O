# Loyalty and Rewards Program using Fungible Tokens

## Overview
This project aims to develop a blockchain-enabled loyalty and rewards program for E-commerce platforms. By leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology, the program enhances security, transparency, and user engagement in loyalty programs. Users earn fungible tokens for various actions, such as purchases, referrals, and social media interactions, which can be redeemed for rewards from partners and sellers.

## Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms often struggle to offer efficient and transparent loyalty programs due to limitations in current systems. Traditional reward programs lack transparency and can be complex to manage, resulting in user disengagement. High transaction costs and scalability issues further hinder these programs from reaching their full potential.

## Proposed Solution
Our solution employs blockchain technology to address these challenges. By utilizing the Polygon network and smart contracts written in Solidity, we create a secure and scalable ecosystem for loyalty tokens. ExpressJS is used to build the user-friendly web interface for managing rewards and tracking progress. MongoDB stores user data, and Remix IDE facilitates smart contract development and testing.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: ExpressJS, HTML, CSS
- Blockchain: Solidity, Polygon network
- Database: MongoDB
- Development Tools: Remix IDE

## Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Remix IDE for Solidity development
3. MongoDB set up and running
4. Knowledge of blockchain concepts and ExpressJS

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure MongoDB connection in `config.js`
4. Set up and deploy smart contracts using Remix IDE and Polygon network
5. Run the ExpressJS server: `npm start`
6. Access the application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Additional Notes
- Ensure Remix IDE is properly configured for Solidity development on the Polygon network.
- Keep your smart contracts secure and well-audited before deployment.
- Regularly back up your MongoDB data to prevent data loss.
